# SiteSurvey
Customizable fake Android survey app for in-person social engineering.

# Premise
Doing some in-person social engineering? Set this app up on an Android phone or tablet, and as you're wrapping up your site visit, tell them that their company wants them to fill out a quick survey about your supposed service call. The first screen will ask them to enter their username and password, which are saved for you to review later. Then, they'll be presented with up to three survey questions that you can customize.

# Options
* You can get to the admin login by clicking on the gear icon on the main screen.
  - The default password is "SiteSurvey".
* View Loot - Review or clear the saved credentials.
* Admin Password - Set your own admin password, or reset it back to "SiteSurvey".
* Login Screen Settings - Set or clear the following options:
  - A custom company name to appear on the main screen, instead of "SiteSurvey".
  - Custom text for the text box above the login fields.
  - Add a disabled "Domain Name" field above the username and password.
* Survey Questions - Set or clear the three survey questions. You don't have to set all three, but there does have to be at least one to avoid a warning after entering credentials from the main screen, and they need to be entered in order. Survey question answers are "Yes", "Neutral", and "No".
